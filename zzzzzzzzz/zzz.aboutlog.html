<h2>About log </h4>
Have you ever seen the system-log, protocol and reports in the terminal (German: Konsole) of your computer? <br>
It is impressive: it registers almost every single action that you do and the computer does.
I once discovered it and opened it on my macbook because I had an 
issue with my screen saver. It would always deactivate again right after I had gone into 
the sleep modus.
I wanted to know what the issue was/what triggered it, so I went into the log/terminal.
(I forgot the reason but it will come back to me). 
In a world of information-overload and "fanciness" (with all due respect!!!!) I thought that 
such a log for the "thoughts" of a human being would be a wonderful innovation and 
a great way to share information!
