        <b>Explanation:</b> 

        The "tempo-+characteristic-character" are indicating the character of the tempo
        and also the character of a rythm: each rythm has different rules like e.g. certain 
        intonations and tempi/(tempos) besides the tempo of the value of notes!... 
        E.g. a 3/4 rythm is counted on the 1st note and has a tempo close to the 
        value of a 4th note. 
        The 3/4 rythm and also 6/8 rythm are typical rythms for the 
        walz-music. You can search for examples of the different rythm-styles on e.g. 
        <i>www.youtube.com</i>. 

        "Indication of tempo-value of a note/the notes" stands for the value within 
        the rythm, the "tempo-+characteristic-character" as a whole determines it more 
        outside of it.

        - For theory I recommend the book <b>"ABC Musik - Allgemeine Musiklehre"</b> from Wieland Ziegenrücker (only in German-unfortunately).
        - for ear training a lot of <i>good exercise</i> (get teacher..) & beginning of songs for intervall recognition - please ask me!
        - understanding the tonality of music: music is normally "tonal";
        Atonal music also exists, but is not normally in use.
        Tonal music is based on the principle of the cadence. This is so to say the principle of music 
        and is thus crucial for understanding. The cadence if built on the tonica, subdominant and dominant.
        All tonal pieces are based upon this basic principle..
