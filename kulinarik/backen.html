Sweet Baking
The first Pie that I have baked was The Banana Cream Pie.

It was followed by - vegan - (!) Brownies. Both I love.

I have often baked yeast plaits (German "Hefezopf") and sometimes banana-bread.

As my focus has been on bread baking until now â€‹I am not as much experienced in this field. But I shall add some cake-recipes and instructions for Sweet Baking (e.g. baking with yeast) that have proven themselves to be excellent here in the future! (Recipes of pastries are often not successful, also not always easy to do, I have found(!))
