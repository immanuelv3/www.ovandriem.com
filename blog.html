 Internet Connection through Ethernet without WIFI

I believe/my feeling is that surfing through WIFI, Wireless Fidelity, can pose a threat for health. 

This is why I have a connection through an Ethernet Cable which also requires an Ethernet Adapter. 

As I have a 250 mbit/s DSL internet connection I am using a "USB 3.0 to Gigabit"-adapter (by the way USB 3.0 to R45 Gigabit Ethernet Network Adapter and USB 3.0 to Gigabit Super Speed Ethernet Adapter are all but the same). USB 3.0 is 10x as fast as USB 2.0, which is why another adapter is not adequate with my connection. As I do not wish a blinking light on my adapter (it takes energy....(?)) I have luckily found one and an only one without (Addendum, May 13th 2025: this is not true, as I had to assume when I received the product. Nobody had given me an answer to my question on www.Amazon.de if it blinked(!)... I guess it (the question) is/was of no importance...) But it is a good Adapter- it is from the German brand Hama...) As there are no ethernet-adapters without blinking light I now want to switch to USB-Connection between my MacBook and my "Fritz!Box" (Brand-Name of my router- typical brand and probably most used for routers). (Addendum, June 8th 2025)

I recommend (and only recommend!) the provider Deutsche Telekom and not another company that are not as good.

The annoyances in the World Wide Web

There are and always reoccur certain annoyances in the internet. 

E.g. spam-Emails are such an illustrious example. Also bots in Instagram that "abonnate you and like your posts and send you messages and you cannot avoid, even by changing your channel to "private". It is almost impossible to have a normal business-life on etsy, where one is flooded by fake potential buyers. Ebay has also become insecure, but to a light degree. 

One prominent and very bothering subject for me are the update-emails from the online store Amazon:

for every order that you place you receive not only a purchase confirmation email, but also a sending confirmation! Both I do not wish and I cannot opt out! I do know that others are also concerned by this and I am engaging in ending these mandatory information-emails.
