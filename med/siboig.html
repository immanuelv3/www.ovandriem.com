<b>MY HEALTH PROBLEMS (SIBO, HIT, DIGESTIVE + Hypothyroidism)</b>
<br>
Who am I? Immanuel, year of birth: 1988. In school I was called „Ima“.
I am Dutch and American and was born in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.
I taught myself baking in more than a decade; Just like music and theory, I sing and play piano. I studied Islamic Studies and Judaism…
I had learned many Arabic words during some school-classes and outside for my leisure until then.
<br>
As baby I could not digest the „milk“ well and had to vomit it/spit it out. When child I only liked white bread and spaghetti, French Fries, Pizza, the typical favorite foods that kids like so often. No vegetables, besides maybe tomatoes and a few others.
Almost a teen a neighbor-friend told me that he was bloated after eating, just like me, I told him!…
I suffered from gases sometimes, also I remember light heartburn and acid reflux on a permanent basis-
like so many do, I hear today….
The symptoms worthened over time- severe digestive problems especially after drinking milk occured: I became terribly bloated and suffered diarrhea, constipation and gases. And my skin had been terribly looking and with acne since my teen-years all ready. I was socially completely isolated.
I had no idea why, would hope it was temporarily, and kept on!
I felt and was miserable and handycapped for years. When I was 23 I took my symptoms serious and looked for help: I went to a proctologue and gastroenterologist in my home-town Freiburg im Breisgau (a city with 230.000 inhabitants and approx. 10% students) located next to the Black Forest. The former didn´t see anything irregular and the latter tested me for SIBO- negatively. „This could not be“ I told myself and
continued my life just as it was at home with my mother. And the symptoms worthened more. I did not understand what was happening. I baked my own bread as I was in the process of learning and progress (it´s extremely difficult) and drank only certain milk, that I had to heat until boiling-point. I still suffered problems from other foods and drinks.
A second search for help started then. I went to the Gastroenterology section of the University Clinic.
<br>
They suggested a test for SIBO again! I thought it could not be, my symptoms were just too serious for „that“, which I did not precisely know.
A friendly assistent in a store wrote me down the address of a good doctor, specialized in naturopathic treatments, for digestive issues.
He immediately recognized SIBO in the description of my ailments. I went back to the University Clinic for testing.
And the result was positive(!) The reason why it had not been diagnosed 9 years before is that they not tested with methane, only hydrogene, although my bacteria only reacted with methane, I had a methane-SIBO! Those bacteria feed off from food, carbohydrates, and ferment them, which created gas-
the reasons for the resulting symptoms. This remains a problem and I am very concerned and involved in speaking about it to the society and doctoral practices.
My researches on healing lead me to Mrs. Kirsten Greene, a very international Naturopath, residing in Bali, Indonesia, today, and her Instagram-Channel („thesiboqueen“) and I bought all the books I could get on SIBO (e.g. and a.o. SIBO made simple by the American from New York Phoebe Lapine and „The SIBO Solution“ by Sylvie McCracken).
I tested all foods and after a longer time of testing I eventually started to feel better. I healed myself with natural antibiotics and was free of SIBO in January 2023, almost precisely one year after the diagnosis. But now I still experienced serious health issues! The reason was a Histamine Intolerance (HIT), which 50 % of SIBO sufferers have. The Microbiological Doctor also made me do a microbiome-test, which diagnosed a lot of gut issues, and said that my gut health was „70%“.<br>
<br>
It helped also a third doctor (a doctor specialized in Natural Medicine) understand that I have/had a sensitivity to proteins (I suffered gases from this too and that is the reason why I had gone to her)
I have HIT it until this day, but hope to make progress and heal… You can discover what it is in my channel!
I have also had „hypothyroidism“, but not a too bad value. With appropriate life-style and nutrition measures plus some natural medicine I was able to recuperate from that after a few months.
I am principally well today, as I am free of SIBO, and know what my problems are and can treat them!
Today, with 37, I bake a lot again (after some long pauses) (without yeast, because of my HIT- Histamine Intolerance, {I don´t tolerate the local yeast-bread, but some others yes}) instead with soda and vinegar (which is unavailable otherwise!) and can lead a „normal life“…
I eat a healthy diet with a lot of variety and vegetables, orientating to the rule „40+“ of different vegetables as I learned, which contributes to a good sleep also, and watch that my life style is in a „good“ or beneficial balance for my health!
<br>
 I today and now do believe and think to know that my occasional excessive alcohol consumption in the social frame in my teen years could be one of the main reasons for my digestive problems a.o. the sibo.
