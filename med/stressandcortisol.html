<h3>Stress and Cortisol </h3>

Did you know that stress is most often linked to Cortisol levels?

Cortisol is a hormone. 

This is good to know as it´s the reason for the symptoms and 

condition!

It is important to relieve/control stress as it influences our health, the immune system e.g. It diminishes/can diminish fertility.

It also stands in relation with Thyroid Conditions e.g. such as Hypothyroidism (see chapter on Hypothyroidism and referral to ND Dr. Emily Lipinski.)  

E.g. wounds cannot heal properly and health not regenerate

when the body is under constant stress!
